        Hello! My name is Wilfredo and life has been a bit of a wild ride for me as far as figuring out my place 
        in the world. I was huge into sports in my youth, baseball and football being the two I put many years of 
        my time into. After Highschool I attended Schoolcraft College for almost a full semester before I recieved 
        my biggest, life changing phone call. Ford Motor Company contacted me to start and gave me the choice of 
        either declining their offer or working for them and quitting school. I chose the latter.. After almost 
        7years, I made a huge pivot deciding to give Grand Circus a try as a way to get back this lost time and 
        make something out of this ever fleeting life.
