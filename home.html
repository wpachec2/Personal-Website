            Developing in Grand Circus has been pretty intense so far but is definitely coming together. Learning
            the ins and outs of what is required for putting code together has been very eye-opening to say the
            least. Code is incredibly frustrating when trying to find the correct orientation but is beyond
            satisfying when everything runs the way it was intended. P.S. Huge thank you to my Teacher Justin and T.A.
            Josh for for being so present and hands on.

        I grew up in Romulus, MI until the end of Elementary School where me and my family moved to Canton, MI.
        The early days were a blast growing up, tons of new faces, new friends, new enviornments to explore and
        a lot of changes as the years went on. Many hardships overcame and many lessions learned but thats all
        just part of growing up.
